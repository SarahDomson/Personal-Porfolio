# Recreating This Portfolio Using React.js 
https://levitkanner.github.io/me/
This repository documents my journey to learning **React.js** by rebuilding my portfolio project. ðŸš€  


## Why This Project?  
After completing my frontend development project using **Tailwind CSS** and **JavaScript**, I decided to take the next step by learning **React.js**. This project allows me to:  
- Understand React concepts like components, state, and props.  
- Build reusable UI components to streamline future projects.  
- Improve my overall frontend development skills.  

## Whatâ€™s Included  
- A **modern and responsive portfolio design** recreated from scratch.  
- Use of React.js for building components and managing application state.  
- Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring clean and maintainable code.  
- Vite for fast development and a lightweight project setup.  

## Milestones  
1. Set up the project environment with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.  
2. Build reusable React components for each section of the portfolio.  
3. Implement responsive design principles to make it look great on all screen sizes.  
4. Add interactivity using React hooks (e.g., handling user interactions).  
5. Optimize performance and deploy the project.  

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone this repository:  
   git clone (https://github.com/SarahDomson/Personal-Porfolio)

2. cd Personal-Portfolio

3. npm install

4. npm start
